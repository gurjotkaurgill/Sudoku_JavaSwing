## ðŸ’¡ Programming Concepts Used

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Code is split into multiple classes (`App`, `Sudoku`, `SudokuData`), each handling specific responsibilities.
  - Encapsulation and modularity are used to keep logic organized.

- **GUI Development:**
  - Java Swing is used to create the interface with panels, buttons, labels, and layout managers.

- **Event-Driven Programming:**
  - Action listeners are attached to buttons to handle user interactions in real-time.

- **Data Management:**
  - Puzzle and solution data are stored as 2D arrays of strings.
  - Separation of data (`SudokuData`) from logic (`Sudoku`) follows good software design principles.
